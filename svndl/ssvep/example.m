%% Examples of provided plotting routines --- USER uncomments/comments plotting calls & runs as desired ---

%% For SNR figures, run ONE of the following:

%[snrFigNums] = plotSnr(rcaData,noiseData,rcaSettings); % generates two plots: one with subplots for each RC, one with subplots for each frequency
%[snrFigNums] = plotSnr(rcaData,noiseData,rcaSettings,[],ozData,ozNoiseData); % additionally creates a plot comparing RC1 to the comparison sensor

% OR provide the name of the comparison electrode as a field in
% plotSettings and then call plotSnr:
plotSettings.comparisonName = 'OZ';
[snrFigNums] = plotSnr(rcaData,noiseData,rcaSettings,plotSettings,ozData,ozNoiseData);

%% For PowerDiva style plots with noise and signal indicated by separate
% markers, with separate subplots for every combination of RC x frequency
plotSettings.conditionColors = [0 0 1; 1 0 0];
plotSettings.showConditions = true;
plotSettings.errorType = 'SEM';
% evaluate ONE of the following:

%figNum = plotFreqByComp(rcaData,noiseData,rcaSettings,plotSettings) % generates one plot without the comparison data
figNum = plotFreqByComp(rcaData,noiseData,rcaSettings,plotSettings,ozData,ozNoiseData); % generates the same plot with an extra column for the comparison sensor

%% Example plot of threshold fit (### want to make fewer requirements for user to set plotSettings..)
plotSettings.titleOn = true;
plotSettings.xlabel = 'Relative Disparity (arc min)';
plotSettings.xTick = rcaSettings.binLevels{1}([1 5 10]);

%% Print figures to a file

if printFigures, for f=allFigNumbers, figure(f); print('-dpsc',[saveFileNamePath,'.ps'],'-append'), end, end
