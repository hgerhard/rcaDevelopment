This subdirectory contains code for analyzing and plotting RCA results run on (sweep) SSVEP data.

To gain full functionality, you should download the latest version of sweepAnalysis, a free public repository on GitHub by Holly Gerhard (who also developed most of this code up through early 2016). It is available here:

https://github.com/hgerhard/sweepAnalysis

(use the “Download ZIP” button and then add the full directory and its subdirectories to your MATLAB path.)

An example script has been created to illustrate some of the functionality of this subdirectory. See example.m to get started.
